# Email Extractor: Web Scraping with Asynchronous Power 🚀

Welcome to the **Email Extractor** project! This tool leverages the **Aynschrpus mechanism library** to scrape email addresses from websites efficiently by running multiple browser instances simultaneously. Perfect for developers looking to master asynchronous web scraping or extract emails at scale! 🎯

## 📌 Project Overview

The Email Extractor demonstrates how to:
- Use the **Aynschrpus mechanism library** for seamless web scraping.
- Open **multiple browser instances** concurrently to boost efficiency.
- Extract email addresses from websites and save them to a file (`extracted_emails.txt`).
- Provide a simple, customizable template for building your own web scraper.

This project is designed to solve common challenges developers face when managing multiple browser instances and extracting data from websites. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned coder, this tool is a great starting point for your scraping adventures! 🕸️

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Email Extractor:

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.7+** installed on your system. You'll also need the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory in your command prompt or terminal and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command installs all the necessary libraries, including the Aynschrpus mechanism library, to power the scraper.

### 3. Prepare URLs
Create a file named `urls_to_scrape.txt` in the project directory. Add the URLs of the websites you want to scrape, with **one URL per line**. For example:

```
https://example.com
https://anotherexample.com
```

### 4. Run the Scraper
Execute the `Email-extractor.py` script using one of the following methods:
- **Command Line**:
  ```bash
  python Email-extractor.py
  ```
- **IDE**: Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., PyCharm, VSCode) and run the `Email-extractor.py` file.

The scraper will launch multiple browser instances, extract email addresses from the provided URLs, and save them to `extracted_emails.txt` in the project directory.

## 📂 Output
All extracted email addresses are saved in the `extracted_emails.txt` file, making it easy to review and use the collected data.
